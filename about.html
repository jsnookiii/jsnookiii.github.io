## About

I believe that learning from your failures is just as important as learning from your successes.  By failing at something new you quickly learn what you need to know and what skills you already have.  So as I try new skill I will show you my successes as well as my failures and I will tell you how to learn from my mistakes as well.  Please follow allong and join me on this adventure.
