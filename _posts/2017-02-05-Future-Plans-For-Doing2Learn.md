## Future Plans

I Was once told that to successed in life you must know where your going and where you have been.  Well for as long as I can remember I have loved to fly in planes.  I would say it is more of an addiction than any thing else.  Most people I knew joined the USAF to serve their country well I would say it was more for to feed my addiction of being around planes.  See Commercial Flights are like a Gateway Drug
