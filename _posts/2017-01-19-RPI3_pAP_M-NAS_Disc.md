### Project RPi3 pAP M-NAS - Discription

   Project RPi3 (Raspberry Pi 3) Portable Access Point with built in Media server and Network Attached Storage(NAS) Device is meant to allow for a portable access point with built in storage and backup features.  With my Wife and Kids Lex(4), Mac(2) & X(2) we spend a every chance we get out of the house as a family and visit family who doesn't live in the local area.  When we do that the kids are stuck in their car seats for up to 2 hours or more at a time with only the games on their cheap tablets for entertainment.

   The RPi3 pAP M-NAS is intended to be a portable nethod for accessing media and files withous use of the internet while also allowing internet access when we are at home.  with a set up that enable the RPi3 to work as a NAS, an Access Point for internet connection, & a Plex server for media playback. This would allow multiple devices to have access to said content with very little effort.  The addition of an automatic shutdown button to have a one press shutdown button.  the system should be powereed via on connection and have enough current to power all the directly connected devices.  With a pleasing yet simple case design that allows access to vital ports.
   
   Next time we will go over how we set up the hardware and software.
