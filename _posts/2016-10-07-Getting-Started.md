### Getting Started

Fear of Failure is what stops most from even trying, and yes I am afraid of failing.  Today I set out to post one update a week on every project.

With this first set we will look at what I have learned while getting started with 3d Printing

1)	** Plan for the print to fail.

			Now I'm not saying every print will fail but there is a chance that it will fail so if you start off with the out look of this print will fail then when it does you won't be suprised.  When you start off with this out look you plan every detail of the print so that it will succeed.
            
2)	** The Print bed is never Flat
			Everyone I have talked to who uses a heated aluminum print bed says the same thing, The print bed will warp with repeated heating a cooling cycles.  I have found this to be true and have started always printing with a raft.
            
3)	** Always check you Filament

            When you are printing a 12 Hour print and you are about 5-6 hours in the last thing you want to hear or see the filament running out.
            
4)	** Post printing is Important

            So I have found that sanding and polishing a Print is harder than i would of thought.  If you watch this video [Painting & Finishing 3D Printed Models: Harry Potter Elder Wand](https://youtu.be/pnqntteQx80) by Joel Telling and Bill Doran.  
            
Untill Next time Keep Learning from your Failures
